      <h3>Introducing Readability</h3>
      <p>Written English is becoming more readable, utilizing shorter sentences and words. This concept known as readability finds its roots in the theory that English is growing to become more conversational.</p>
      <p>A vareity of formulas have been created to measure this trend. There are a number of variations on this but they essentially measure vocabulary difficulty. Shown here is a simplified version of the Flesch-Kincaid formula that measures Sentence Length and Vocabulary length.</p>
      <pre>Average Sentence Length X Average Word Length</pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Readable Newspapers</h3>
      <p>The readability trend has been observed in many places, the mainstream origins of this were first applied on a major scale with newspapers where improvements in readability were shown to increase newspaper circulation.</p>
      <p>Shown here are a selection of studies highlighting readability trends in certain sources. The graph is a modified version of the <b>Gunning Fog readability index</b> that translates readability measures to approximate reading levels by grade of the United States schools</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Readable Everything</h3>
      <p>The trend to readable English has been observed in formats outside of Newspapers including, especially in books. The US government has also promoted readable writing and regulated some instances where readable writing must be done.</p>
      <p>For reference, popular social media posts are done at a low readability level.</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Domain Exception</h3>
      <p>However, not all English allows for high readability. Of note are domain sources like academic papers, government writing and business related reading. These instances require specific language that can include long words specific to that source.</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>

    <div>
      <h3>Readability Objective</h3>
      <p>The objective of readability is to improve reading comprehension, lets take a look at reading comprehension in the United States.</p>

      <h3>The Nation's Report Card</h3>
      <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest and nationally representative assessment of what U.S. students know, the results are referred to as the Nation's Report Card.</p> 
      <p>For the reading comprehension portion, students read grade-appropriate texts and are asked questions that assess their interpretative and critical understanding.</p>
      <p>Scores are aggregated into achievement levels for each grade where:</p>
      <p><b>Basic</b> indicates partial mastery of reading comprehension at the current grade.</p>
      <p><b>Proficient</b> represents solid competency of reading comprhension at the current grade and application of knowledge to real world situations.</p>
      <p><b>Advanced</b> presumes mastery of Basic and Proficient</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-1'>
      <h3>Grade: Needs Improvement</h3>
      <p>Shown here are the national results for 12th graders which shows a slow decline since 1992, the furthest currently available dataset for 12th graders.</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-2'>
      <h3>It gets worse</h3>
      <p>The assessment gets more concerning as reading ability percentiles are considered. Students in the lowest groups continue to fall further and further behind which becomes increasingly harder to correct as these students mature into adults.</p>
      <p>The causes of this are mixed. One positive aspect is that high-school graduation rates are higher, where in the past students who struggled with reading would likely drop-out. However, as they stay on students continue to struggle with reading and lack of funding in certain school distrcits means teachers cannot dedicate the appropriate time to these students in need.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-3'>
      <h3>State-level Variances</h3>
      <p>Scores also vary at the state-level which reflects America's lack of standardization when it comes to determing what gets taught. Currently students are taught consistent reading fundamentals but additional subject learning differs by state. </p>
      <p>Some distrcits emphasize additional reading strategies focused on test taking. However cognitive scientists believe more emphasis should be put on background knowledge and learning keywords. </p>

      <h3>Reading Comprehension</h3>
      Reading comprehension is the process of reading text to understand its meaning to integrate with what the reader already knows. 
      </div>
      <div id='container-3-2'>
      <h3>Construction-Integration</h3> 
        In the construction-integration model, the comprehension process is shown in blue to represent the three levels that work in parallel to process and meaning out of text.
        The white areas represent the start from text to understanding by the reader.
      </div>
      <div id='container-3-3'>
        <h3>Readability Impacts Construction</h3>
        <p>Readability will have the most impact on the lower levels of processing, where the actual text meaning is constrcuted.</p>
        <p>However in the situation model, where the text meaning is integrated with prior knowledge, benefits can only be derived with a greater knowledge base.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Longform Text</h3>
        Additional challenges are presented in the construction level when text increases in length as it creates additional relationships and words to define.

        <h3>Linear Reading</h3>
        Typical linear reading follows a pattern like this, the blue circles represent time spent looking. Larger circles mean more time viewing.

        <h3>Digital Skim Reading</h3>
        Digital reading follows a skimming pattern that forms an "F" like shape as time goes on, for longer forms of text a lot of the text is ultimately not read.
        This method is very effective at finding information online but not as effective when it comes to reading longer forms of text.
        Filler text

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Carry-over</h3>
        Some educators suspect this skim reading is carrying over to all forms of reading, not surprising given how screens have become the dominant medium for reading.

"Earth is the planet we live on. It is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars. The large mass of the Sun makes Earth move around it, just as the mass of Earth makes the moon move around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. Earth goes around the Sun once (one year) for every 365​ 1⁄4 times it turns around (one day). Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that has a large amount of liquid water. About 74% of the surface of Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water. Because of this, people sometimes call it the blue planet. Because of its water, Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals which require water to survive The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen. The living part of Earth's surface is called the biosphere.",
  "A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. Trees can live for many years. The oldest tree ever discovered is approximately 5,000 years old and the oldest tree from the UK is about 1,000. The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. The roots of a tree are usually under the ground. However, this is not always true. The roots of the mangrove tree are often under water. A single tree has many roots. The roots carry nutrients and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree. They can also breathe in air. Sometimes, roots are specialized into aerial roots, which can also provide support, as is the case with the banyan tree. The trunk is the main body of the tree. The trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage. Branches grow from the trunk. They spread out so that the leaves can get more sunlight. The leaves of a tree are green most of the time, but they can come in many colors, shapes and sizes. The leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow, and to reproduce. Trees and shrubs take in water and carbon dioxide and give out oxygen with sunlight to form sugars. This is the opposite of what animals do in respiration. Plants also do some respiration using oxygen the way animals do. They need oxygen as well as carbon dioxide to live. Trees are renewable resources because, if cut down, other trees can grow in their place."
