      <h3>Introducing Readability</h3>
      <p>Written English is becoming more readable, utilizing shorter sentences and words. This concept known as readability finds its roots in the theory that English is growing to become more conversational.</p>
      <p>A vareity of formulas have been created to measure this trend. There are a number of variations on this but they essentially measure vocabulary difficulty. Shown here is a simplified version of the Flesch-Kincaid formula that measures Sentence Length and Vocabulary length.</p>
      <pre>Average Sentence Length X Average Word Length</pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Readable Newspapers</h3>
      <p>The readability trend has been observed in many places, the mainstream origins of this were first applied on a major scale with newspapers where improvements in readability were shown to increase newspaper circulation.</p>
      <p>Shown here are a selection of studies highlighting readability trends in certain sources. The graph is a modified version of the <b>Gunning Fog readability index</b> that translates readability measures to approximate reading levels by grade of the United States schools</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Readable Everything</h3>
      <p>The trend to readable English has been observed in formats outside of Newspapers including, especially in books. The US government has also promoted readable writing and regulated some instances where readable writing must be done.</p>
      <p>For reference, popular social media posts are done at a low readability level.</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Domain Exception</h3>
      <p>However, not all English allows for high readability. Of note are domain sources like academic papers, government writing and business related reading. These instances require specific language that can include long words specific to that source.</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>

    <div>
      <h3>Readability Objective</h3>
      <p>The objective of readability is to improve reading comprehension, lets take a look at reading comprehension in the United States.</p>

      <h3>The Nation's Report Card</h3>
      <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest and nationally representative assessment of what U.S. students know, the results are referred to as the Nation's Report Card.</p> 
      <p>For the reading comprehension portion, students read grade-appropriate texts and are asked questions that assess their interpretative and critical understanding.</p>
      <p>Scores are aggregated into achievement levels for each grade where:</p>
      <p><b>Basic</b> indicates partial mastery of reading comprehension at the current grade.</p>
      <p><b>Proficient</b> represents solid competency of reading comprhension at the current grade and application of knowledge to real world situations.</p>
      <p><b>Advanced</b> presumes mastery of Basic and Proficient</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-1'>
      <h3>Grade: Needs Improvement</h3>
      <p>Shown here are the national results for 12th graders which shows a slow decline since 1992, the furthest currently available dataset for 12th graders.</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-2'>
      <h3>Lack of Reading</h3>
      <p>While there is likely a multitude of reasons for this, one consistent measure of reading comprehension performance is how much time a student spends reading outside of class. Students are reading less across the board.</p>
      <p>The causes of this are mixed. One positive aspect is that high-school graduation rates are higher, where in the past students who struggled with reading would likely drop-out. However, as they stay on students continue to struggle with reading and lack of funding in certain school distrcits means teachers cannot dedicate the appropriate time to these students in need.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-3'>
      <h3>State-level Variances</h3>
      <p>Scores also vary at the state-level which reflects America's lack of standardization when it comes to determing what gets taught. Currently students are taught consistent reading fundamentals but additional subject learning differs by state. </p>
      <p>Some distrcits emphasize additional reading strategies focused on test taking. However cognitive scientists believe more emphasis should be put on background knowledge and learning keywords. </p>

      <h3>Reading Comprehension</h3>
      Reading comprehension is the process of reading text to understand its meaning to integrate with what the reader already knows. 
      </div>
      <div id='container-3-2'>
      <h3>Construction-Integration</h3> 
        In the construction-integration model, the comprehension process is shown in blue to represent the three levels that work in parallel to process and meaning out of text.
        The white areas represent the start from text to understanding by the reader.
      </div>
      <div id='container-3-3'>
        <h3>Readability Impacts Construction</h3>
        <p>Readability will have the most impact on the lower levels of processing, where the actual text meaning is constrcuted.</p>
        <p>However in the situation model, where the text meaning is integrated with prior knowledge, benefits can only be derived with a greater knowledge base.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Longform Text</h3>
        Additional challenges are presented in the construction level when text increases in length as it creates additional relationships and words to define.

        <h3>Linear Reading</h3>
        Typical linear reading follows a pattern like this, the blue circles represent time spent looking. Larger circles mean more time viewing.

      <div id='container-3-6'>
        <h3>Digital Skim Reading</h3>
        Digital reading follows a skimming pattern that forms an "F" like shape as time goes on, for longer forms of text a lot of the text is ultimately not read.
        This method is very effective at finding information online but not as effective when it comes to reading longer forms of text.
        Filler text

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Carry-over</h3>
        Some educators suspect this skim reading is carrying over to all forms of reading, not surprising given how screens have become the dominant medium for reading.

"Earth is the planet we live on. It is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars. The large mass of the Sun makes Earth move around it, just as the mass of Earth makes the moon move around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. Earth goes around the Sun once (one year) for every 365​ 1⁄4 times it turns around (one day). Earth is the only planet in the Solar System that has a large amount of liquid water. About 74% of the surface of Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water. Because of this, people sometimes call it the blue planet. Because of its water, Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals which require water to survive. The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen. The living part of Earth's surface is called the biosphere.",
  "A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. Trees can live for many years. The oldest tree ever discovered is approximately 5,000 years old and the oldest tree from the UK is about 1,000. The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. The roots of a tree are usually under the ground. However, this is not always true. The roots of the mangrove tree are often under water. A single tree has many roots. The roots carry nutrients and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree. They can also breathe in air. Sometimes, roots are specialized into aerial roots, which can also provide support, as is the case with the banyan tree. The trunk is the main body of the tree. The trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage. Branches grow from the trunk. They spread out so that the leaves can get more sunlight. The leaves of a tree are green most of the time, but they can come in many colors, shapes and sizes. The leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow, and to reproduce. Trees and shrubs take in water and carbon dioxide and give out oxygen with sunlight to form sugars. This is the opposite of what animals do in respiration. Plants also do some respiration using oxygen the way animals do. They need oxygen as well as carbon dioxide to live. Trees are renewable resources because, if cut down, other trees can grow in their place."

"Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29,2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics. Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions, and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by elevation, and by proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heat waves, occurs in most areas and has a large impact on life. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.",
  "In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world. A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development. Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead. Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies."
