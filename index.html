      <h3>Introducing Readability</h3>
      <p>Written English is becoming more readable, utilizing shorter sentences and words. This concept known as readability finds its roots in the theory that English is growing to become more conversational.</p>
      <p>A vareity of formulas have been created to measure this trend. There are a number of variations on this but they essentially measure vocabulary difficulty. Shown here is a simplified version of the Flesch-Kincaid formula that measures Sentence Length and Vocabulary length.</p>
      <pre>Average Sentence Length X Average Word Length</pre>
    </div>

      <h3>Readable Newspapers</h3>
      <p>The readability trend has been observed in many places, the mainstream origins of this were first applied on a major scale with newspapers where improvements in readability were shown to increase newspaper circulation.</p>
      <p>Shown here are a selection of studies highlighting readability trends in certain sources. The graph is a modified version of the <b>Gunning Fog readability index</b> that translates readability measures to approximate reading levels by grade of the United States schools</p>

      <h3>Readable Everything</h3>
      <p>The trend to readable English has been observed in formats outside of Newspapers including, especially in books. The US government has also promoted readable writing and regulated some instances where readable writing must be done.</p>
      <p>For reference, popular social media posts are done at a low readability level.</p>
      <pre>
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Domain Exception</h3>
      However, not all English allows for high readability. Of note are domain sources like academic papers, government writing and business related reading. These instances require specific language that can include long words specific to that source.

      <h3>Readability Objective</h3>
      The objective of readability is to improve reading comprehension, lets take a look at reading comprehension in the United States.

      <h3>The Nation's Report Card</h3>
      <p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the largest and nationally representative assessment of what U.S. students know, the results are referred to as the Nation's Report Card.</p> 
      <p>For the reading comprehension portion, students read grade-appropriate texts and are asked questions that assess their interpretative and critical understanding.</p>
      <p>Scores are aggregated into achievement levels for each grade where:</p>
      <p><b>Basic</b> indicates partial mastery of reading comprehension at the current grade.</p>
      <p><b>Proficient</b> represents solid competency of reading comprhension at the current grade and application of knowledge to real world situations.</p>
      <p><b>Advanced</b> presumes mastery of Basic and Proficient</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-1'>
      <h3>Grade: Needs Improvement</h3>
      <p>Shown here are the national results for 12th graders which shows a slow decline since 1992, the furthest currently available dataset for 12th graders.</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-2'>
      <h3>It gets worse</h3>
      <p>The assessment gets more concerning as reading ability percentiles are considered. Students in the lowest groups continue to fall further and further behind which becomes increasingly harder to correct as these students mature into adults.</p>
      <p>The causes of this are mixed. One positive aspect is that high-school graduation rates are higher, where in the past students who struggled with reading would likely drop-out. However, as they stay on students continue to struggle with reading and lack of funding in certain school distrcits means teachers cannot dedicate the appropriate time to these students in need.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div id='container-2-3'>
      <h3>State-level Variances</h3>
      <p>Scores also vary at the state-level which reflects America's lack of standardization when it comes to determing what gets taught. Currently students are taught consistent reading fundamentals but additional subject learning differs by state. </p>
      <p>Some distrcits emphasize additional reading strategies focused on test taking. However cognitive scientists believe more emphasis should be put on background knowledge and learning keywords. </p>

      <h3>Model of Comprehension</h3>
      While there is no universally accepted model of how reading comprehension works, cognitive psychologist Walter Kintsch has gained acclaim for his construction-integration model. In this model comprehension is defined as not just the decoding of words and sentences but also making connections of ideas and deriving meaning from a written text.
      </div>
      <div id='container-3-2'>
        In this model, there are three levels that work in parallel to process and meaning out of text.
        <h4>Linguistic Representation</h4>
        The surface form of the text representing the exact words and syntatctic structures of the text.
        <h4>Propostional Abstraction</h4>
        How words and ideas within the text combine to form a semantic idea, essentially the relationship of words in a text. This forms the textbase, the interconnected representation of the propositions, linked through shared arguments.
        <h4>Situation Model</h4>
        The highest level of text comprehension that involves integrating ideas represented in the first two levels with prior knowledge.
      </div>
      <div id='container-3-3'>
      <h3>Examples of Text Comprehension</h3>
      Here using a basic sentence pair we explore how text comprehension works
      <h4>Words and sentence structure</h4>
      Define objects in the sentence
      <h4>How words relate to one another</h4>
      Deriving simple semantic conclusion that the turtle is above the fish
      <h4>Integrate with prior knowledge</h4>
      Using previous knowledge to create a mental image
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Impact of Readability</h3>
        Readability will have the most impact on the lower levels of processing, making it easier to process words and derive meaning. However the highest level of integration where previous knowledge is derived requires drawing on a previous knowledge.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Macro Text</h3>
        Obviously in this simple example things are pretty immeadiate but for longer form texts things become more challenging.

        <h3>Linear Reading</h3>
        Typical linear reading follows a pattern like this, the blue circles represent time spent looking. Larger circles mean more time viewing.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Digital Skim Reading</h3>
        Digital reading follows a skimming pattern that forms an "F" like shape as time goes on, for longer forms of text a lot of the text is ultimately not read.
